FreeFlyer supports [Working With Terrain](docs/Terrain%20Modeling/Working%20With%20Terrain.md) file ingestion, analysis, reporting, and visualization capabilities to aid in ground-based analyses interacting with critical space or air assets. The [Terrain](https://ai-solutions.com/_help_Files/terrain_nanosecond.htm) object is specifically designed to function without calling back to a server application and intelligently [indexes](https://ai-solutions.com/_help_Files/terrain_index_generator.htm) data files so that real-time processing is as fast as possible. Beyond that, a number of industry-standard [file formats](https://ai-solutions.com/_help_Files/terrain_data_files.htm) are supported for use with FreeFlyer's terrain capability, and the object integrates directly with [GroundVehicle](https://ai-solutions.com/_help_Files/groundvehicles.htm) objects to support work focused on ground-based assets that need to interact with terrain.
