FreeFlyer includes many features for interplanetary mission design and analysis. You can use Vectors and Coordinate Systems to define non-Earth-centered reference frames, you can define custom Celestial Objects and specify them as the central body for a Spacecraft or include their effects in the Spacecraft Force Model, and you can modify various properties of FreeFlyer's solar system model.

> [!example] Example
> There are a variety of [Sample Mission Plans](https://ai-solutions.com/_help_Files/sample_mission_plans.htm) (included with your FreeFlyer installation) that demonstrate various applications of these topics. Continue to the [Interplanetary Samples](https://ai-solutions.com/_help_Files/interplanetary_smp.htm) page to view descriptions and images of these examples.
